##Showing K-Nearest Neighbour Machine Learning Algorithm in Python Code

1. First create sample training dataset
2. Assign class for each. Like [2.5,3.5] => Bad and [4.5,5] => Good. So according to this classification is done.
3. Calculate the distance for all datasets.
4. Select the k items with lowest distance. Here k is the number.
5. And select the k item with higest voting which will be the class that Good or Bad for you new data.

##You must have numpy module.
